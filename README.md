# Node.js Backend Learning Repository

This repository contains all the backend code I am learning and implementing while taking the **Backend Development** course at Sheriyans Coding School. If you are also learning backend development, feel free to fork this repository and use the code for your personal projects and learning.

## What This Repository Covers

The repository is structured in a way that each section covers important backend topics such as:

- Setting up a Node.js server with Express
- Handling routes and middleware
- Working with databases (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)
- RESTful API development
- File uploads with Multer
- Authentication and Authorization (JWT, OAuth)
- Error handling
- Deployment tips and more

The code is organized into different folders for easier navigation, and each folder represents a specific topic or project from the course.
